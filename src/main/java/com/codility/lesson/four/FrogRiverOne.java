/***
 * A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. 
 * The frog is initially located on one bank of the river (position 0) and wants to get to the opposite bank (position X+1). 
 * Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.
 *
 * You are given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves. 
 * A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.
 *
 * The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river. 
 * The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the river from 1 to X 
 * (that is, we want to find the earliest moment when all the positions from 1 to X are covered by leaves). 
 * You may assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e.
 * the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.
 *
 * For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
 *
 * A[0] = 1 
 * A[1] = 3 
 * A[2] = 1 
 * A[3] = 4 
 * A[4] = 2 
 * A[5] = 3 
 * A[6] = 5 
 * A[7] = 4 
 * In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. 
 * This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * class Solution { public int solution(int X, int[] A); }
 * that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and integer X,
 * returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.
 *
 * If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, 
 * the function should return âˆ’1.
 *
 * For example, given X = 5 and array A such that:
 *
 * A[0] = 1 
 * A[1] = 3 
 * A[2] = 1 
 * A[3] = 4 
 * A[4] = 2 
 * A[5] = 3 
 * A[6] = 5 
 * A[7] = 4 
 * the function should return 6, as explained above.
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 * N and X are integers within the range [1..100,000]; 
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..X]. 
 *
 * Complexity:
 *
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); 
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(X), 
 * beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). 
 * Elements of input arrays can be modified.

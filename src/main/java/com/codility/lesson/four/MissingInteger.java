/***
 * Write a function:
 *
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 * that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, 
 * returns the minimal positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
 *
 * For example, given:
 *
 * A[0] = 1 
 * A[1] = 3 
 * A[2] = 6 
 * A[3] = 4 
 * A[4] = 1 
 * A[5] = 2 
 * the function should return 5.
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 * N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; 
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
 *
 * Complexity:
 *
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); 
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), 
 * beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). 
 * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
